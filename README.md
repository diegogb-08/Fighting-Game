# :fist_right: Dragon Ball Legends :fist_left:

This repository is about emulating one of the best games ever, **Dragon Ball**. The reason why I chose to do a game about it is because I spent my entire childhood watching every morning the episodes of this amazing series right before going to school. Then I would think that I am Son Goku and that I was flying with his magic cloud.
